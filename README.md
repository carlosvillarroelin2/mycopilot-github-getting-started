As you work in your IDE, you'll most often interact with GitHub Copilot in the following ways:

| Interaction Mode          | 📝 Description                                                                                                                                      | 🎯 Best For                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **⚡ Inline suggestions** | AI-powered code suggestions that appear as you type, offering context-aware completions from single lines to entire functions.                      | Completion of the current line, sometimes a whole new block of code                                              |
| **💬 Ask Mode**           | Optimized for answering questions about your codebase, coding, and general technology concepts.                                                     | Understanding how code works, brainstorming ideas, asking questions                                              |
| **✏️ Edit Mode**          | Optimized for making code edits across multiple files in your project. VS Code directly applies the code changes in the editor for in-place review. | Coding tasks when you have a good understanding of the changes you want to make and which files you want to edit |
| **🤖 Agent Mode**         | Optimized for making autonomous edits across multiple files in your project.                                                                        | Coding tasks when you have a less well-defined task that might also require running terminal commands and tools  |
| **💭 Inline Chat**        | Interactive chat scoped to your current file or selection. Ask questions about specific code blocks.                                                | Code explanations, debugging specific functions, targeted improvements                                           |

As you work, you'll find GitHub Copilot can help out in several places across the `github.com` website and in your favorite coding environments such as VS Code, Jet Brains, and Xcode!
